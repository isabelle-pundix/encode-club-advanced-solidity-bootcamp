When creating the function selector "uint" will be replaced by "uint256"
Could this be used maliciously in an exploit, if so, how would that be done?
`0xa5643bf2`: the Method ID.
This is derived from the signature
`sam(bytes,bool,uint256[])`.
Note that `uint` is replaced with its canonical representation `uint256`.

For example:

```
contract TestTemplate {

    uint public amount;
    address public sender;

    function writeTo (uint _amount) public {
        amount = _amount;
        sender = msg.sender;
    }
}
```

And in another contract call the writeTo function:

```
contract TestTwo {

    uint public amount;
    address public sender;


    function writeTo(address _to, uint _amount) public  {
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = _to.delegatecall(abi.encodeWithSignature("writeTo(uint)", _amount));
    }
}
```

The delegatecall function will fail, since it compiles to writeTo(uint256). Since delegatecall executes code in the caller's context, it can affect the storage and logic of the calling contract.
