Code:
pragma solidity 0.8.6;

contract Deploy1{

    uint256 value1;

    constructor(){
        value1 = 17;
    }

    function read() view public returns (uint256 result){
        return value1;
    }

}

1. When we do the CODECOPY operation, what are we overwriting?
   CODECOPY copies the contract's runtime bytecode from storage to memory. We are overwriting the contract's memory with the contract's bytecode.

2. Could the answer to the above question allow an optimisation?
   a. We can optimise by controlling how much of the bytecode is copied is copied & where it is copied to (reduce unnecessary memory allocations)
   b. Remove non-essential code from the runtime code
   c. Use external libraries to make runtime code smaller

3. Can you trigger a revert in the init code?
   Since the constructor is not marked as payable, sending ether to the constructor will cause it to revert

4. Can you think of a situation where the opcode EXTCODECOPY is used?
   When an external call is made to a contract's code, EXTCODECOPY is used to copy the bytecode into memory.
