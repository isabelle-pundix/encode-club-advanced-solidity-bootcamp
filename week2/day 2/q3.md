function allowanceStorageOffset(account, spender) -> offset {
offset := accountToStorageOffset(account)
mstore(0, offset)
mstore(0x20, spender)
offset := keccak256(0, 0x40)
}

- The function calculates the storage location for an allowance of an ERC20 contract.
- It takes in 2 parameters (account, spender) and returns an offset.

1. Calls another function `accountToStorageOffset` with the account parameter. (Calculation of base storage offset for the account's data)
2. Stores the calculated offset in memory at pos 0
3. Stores the spender address in memory as pos 32
4. Calculates the keccak256 hash of the 64 bytes starting from pos 0 (calculated offset + spender address)

This ensures each account and spender pair will get its own unique storage slot.
